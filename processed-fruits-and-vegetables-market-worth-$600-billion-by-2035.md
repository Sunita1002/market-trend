The global market for processed fruits and vegetables is expected to develop significantly due to the growing consumption of nutritious foods and a preference for healthy lifestyles.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global processed fruits and vegetables market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rise in the Wastage of Fresh Fruits & Vegetables
- Higher Trade of Processed Fruits and Vegetables

**Challenges:**

There are various health issues associated with consuming processed food and vegetables. Washing, cleaning, grinding, cutting, chopping, heating, pasteurizing, blanching, boiling, canning, freezing, drying, dehydrating, mixing, or packing are all the various steps of processing. The food undergoes so many treatments that alters the way they were originally produced. Furthermore, additives, flavorings, nutrients, and other chemical compounds, as well as authorized elements such as salt, sugar, and fat, may be added. As a result, their naturally occurring nutrients are reduced and additional sugar or salt may raise the risk of high blood pressure and diabetes. 

The global processed fruits and vegetables market is divided into fruits and vegetables. The fruits segment is expected to generate the most revenue by the end of 2035, expanding at a considerable CAGR during the forecast period. The segment's rise can be ascribed to an increase in the number of individuals devouring more fruits, followed by an improvement in the number of people being health conscious.  Furthermore, the overall flavor of fruits makes them appealing to veggies. In America, roughly 9% of people take the necessary daily dose of veggies, and approximately 11% of adults consume the recommended daily amount of fruit. Most fruits, on the other hand, barely endure about 4 days after being sliced. Furthermore, humidity and high temperatures cause fruits to spoil within a few hours of being cut. As a result, demand for processed fruits is expected to rise, pushing market growth even more.

By the end of 2035, the North American processed fruits and vegetables market is to generate the highest revenue. The market growth in the region is expected on account of higher demand for processed fruits and vegetables which has increased the import of the fruits and vegetables, as well. People are becoming more conscious about the benefits of consuming fruits and thus spending more on its purchase. In 2020, about 35% of Americans purchased ready-to-eat meals. This could be due to the rising standard of living in the region. Furthermore, a big number of Gen-Z are expected to live independently, and so demand among them is expected to rise, driving the market growth.
