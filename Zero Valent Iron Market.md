**Zero Valent Iron Market Size | Showing Impressive Growth by 2035**

The term "zerovalent iron" (ZVI) refers to different types of iron metal utilized in groundwater remediation. The most often used material for environmental treatment is zerovalent iron (ZVI). ZVI is frequently used as a reductant and can convert (degrade) or sequester a range of pollutants present in soil and groundwater. ZVI comes in many different forms, including granular, nanoscale, bimetallic, and combination products ZVI. ZVI is used in a variety of remediation applications, including injection-based therapies, in situ soil mixing, and permeable reactive barriers.

**Zero Valent Iron Market: Growth Drivers**

The growth of the global [zero-valent iron market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/zero-valent-iron-market/4014) can majorly be attributed to the increasing application of ZVI for the removal of harmful chemicals from the soil and water, including the chlorinated insecticides DDT, DDD, and DDE, backed by the rising consequences of soil and water degradation across the world. According to the United Nations Environment Program, at least 3.2 billion people, or more than 40% of the world's population, are believed to be impacted by the degradation of land and soils. Furthermore, the expanding chemical industry is estimated to hasten market expansion. It was noted that the United States is the world's largest producer of chemicals, accounting for about one-fifth of total output, and the chemical industry generates more than USD 226 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In addition, the rising investment in the chemical sector by important market participants and influential industrialists is anticipated to boost market expansion.

**The global zero-valent iron market is also estimated to grow majorly on account of the following:**

- Increasing soil and water degradation
- Rising environmental concern
- Expanding chemical sector
- Growing need for ZVI in environmental restoration
- Significant rise in pesticide usage

**Zero Valent Iron Market: Restraining Factor**

The main drawbacks of zero-valent iron are low reactivity, an inherent passive layer, a small working pH range, and a reactivity loss over time as a result of the precipitation of metal hydroxides layer on it, resulting in limited efficacy for treating some refractory contaminants. Hence this factor is expected to be the major hindrance to the growth of the global zero-valent iron market during the forecast period.

**Global Zero Valent Iron Segmentation**  

- **By Type (Combined Products, Bimetallic, Nano-scale, Granular, and Others)**

  The granular segment, amongst all the other segments, is anticipated to garner the largest revenue by the end of 2035. Zero-valent iron is used as a reductant in granular form to remove contaminants from groundwater, soils, and sediments, particularly metals and different pesticides. Furthermore, the global increase in groundwater degradation and its negative effects on soil and crops are estimated to boost segment growth. Based on present rates of groundwater depletion, cropping intensity is predicted to decline by 20% overall and by about 70% in the regions with low groundwater levels.

- **By Application (Ground Water Remediation, Soil Remediation, Industrial Reducing Agent, and Others)**

The Asia Pacific zero-valent iron market is anticipated to hold the largest market share by the end of 2035 among the market in all the other regions. The growth of the market can be attributed to the expanding chemical industry in the region. Additionally, the rising soil pollution on account of the increasing usage of pesticides in the region is predicted to boost the market growth. The FAO reports that in 2018, Asia accounted for more than 50% of the world's pesticide consumption and China used 1,774 thousand tons of insecticides overall in that same year. Moreover, the presence of key market players and the rising investment by them in the region is anticipated to propel the market growth.
