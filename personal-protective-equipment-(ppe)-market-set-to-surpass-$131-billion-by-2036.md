**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Market Set to Surpass $131 Billion by 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-market/4724): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036” delivers a detailed competitor’s analysis and a detailed overview of the global personal protective equipment (PPE) market in terms of market segmentation by product type, end-user industry, and by region. 

**Increasing Production of Personal Protection Equipment in Different Places to Drive Growth of Global Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Market**

The global personal protective equipment (PPE) market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the unprecedented spike in the production capacity of PPEs in different countries. Though PPE kits and different gadgets for personal protection were already in use in healthcare and other industries. Moreover, the volume of these PPEs was not sufficient to meet the unforeseen requirement during COVID-19. With the onset of the pandemic, many parts of the world had to boost their production of different protective gadgets. An instance is India, whose production volume of PPEs exhibited remarkable growth within a year starting from January 2020. India faced a serious shortage of PPE kits at the beginning of 2020, when the pandemic had just begun. However, within a year, the production volume for the PPE kits rose to over 1 lakh kits per day.

Another factor driving the market growth of the personal protective equipment market is the alarming number of incidences of fatal injury in the construction industry worldwide. Compared to any other groups, the workers employed in the construction industry are those who are the most exposed to fatal injuries. Workers face many risks to life and health while engaging in large-scale infrastructure development projects. Only engineering and administrative control measures are not sufficient to prevent some of the probable accidents in the construction sites. Therefore, PPE kits are necessary to minimize the exposure of the workers to risks. Moreover, it is estimated that over 10 in every 100000 workers suffer from fatal injuries related to their tasks in the construction industry in the US every year.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global drug delivery systems market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Prevention of Food Contamination in the Food and Beverages Industry
- Lowering the Number of Cases of Fatal Injuries in the Manufacturing Industry

**Challenges:**

The availability of low-quality products in the market and trade restrictions on PPEs in different parts of the world are expected to affect the market growth adversely. Another significant factor that would hinder the demand for PPEs is the probable decline in the demand for PPEs in tandem with the decline in the number of new cases of COVID-19. With strict adherence to the measures meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the viral attack has been successfully contained in many parts of the world. Another factor that is leading to fewer cases of COVID-19 is the successful implementation of vaccines against the virus in all parts of the world. It is estimated that there were about 453 new admissions of COVID per million people in the US in January 2022. However, this count went down to about 109 new cases per million people in the US just after one year.
