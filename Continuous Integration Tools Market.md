Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Continuous Integration Tools Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/continuous-integration-tools-market/5128): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global continuous integration tools market in terms of market segmentation by end-user, deployment mode, component, organization size and by region. 

**Growing Importance of Continuous Integration Tools to Promote Global Market Share of Continuous Integration Tools**

The global continuous integration tools market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing popularity of continuous integration tools. For instance, more than 40% of developers now acknowledge the regular use of continuous integration tools and continuous delivery solutions. Continuous delivery and integration practices are becoming more common as DevOps grows in popularity as it used by over 45% of the software development teams, to detect errors in code at any stage of app development. 

Additionally, Jenkins has been around for many years, making it one of the most well-known, and widely used Continuous Integration tools used by DevOps teams to construct software projects by continuously creating and testing them. Moreover, it is a free and open-source CI/CD server that aids in the automation of many phases of software development and is used to implement pipelines, which are CI/CD workflows. 

The global continuous integration tools market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing usage in software development. Continuous integration tools are used in conjunction with software development, which often integrates code into a shared repository and aids in incorporating new code modifications into the main source code branch regularly.
