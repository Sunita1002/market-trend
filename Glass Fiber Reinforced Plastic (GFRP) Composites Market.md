The market is segmented by type, resin type and manufacturing process. Based on resin type, the polyester segment is anticipated to acquire the largest share during the forecast period on the back of superior corrosion resistance, and high-performance properties of this type of resin. Additionally, by manufacturing process, the compression & injection molding segment is projected to grab the largest share over the forecast period attributing to the low scrap rate, fast cycle time and less mold-clamping pressure offered by this process. 

Geographically, the global glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites market is segmented into five major regions, namely North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. Asia pacific is evaluated to grab the largest share in the market during the forecast period attributing to the increasing number of residential construction projects, and high levels of urbanization in the region. Moreover, the market in Asia Pacific is assessed to witness noteworthy growth in the future owing to the growing consumption of GFRP composites in construction, electronics and wind energy industries in the region.

The research is global in nature and covers detailed analysis on the market in North America (U.S., Canada), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands & Luxembourg, NORDIC [Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark], Poland, Turkey, Russia, Rest of Europe), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of Latin America), Asia-Pacific (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Rest of Asia-Pacific), Middle East and Africa (Israel, GCC [Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman], North Africa, South Africa, Rest of Middle East and Africa). In addition, analysis comprising market size, Y-O-Y growth & opportunity analysis, market players’ competitive study, investment opportunities, demand for future outlook etc. has also been covered and displayed in the research report.

**Rising Demand for the Product from Developing Nations to Bolster Market Growth**

Rapidly growing oil & gas, chemicals and sewage industries in emerging economies of Asia Pacific and Latin America regions is predicted to drive the demand for GFRP pipes in the coming years. Along with this, high rate of urbanization in developing nations is also raising the demand for water management, which in turn is also evaluated to drive significant market growth in the near future.

However, high cost of the material is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the global glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites market over the forecast period.
