**Increasing Adoption of Recycled Water to Boost the Market Growth**

Water scarcity is a major problem in the present times, and various government authorities are focusing on water recycling and waste water management. As a result, dissolved oxygen sensors are required amongst water treatment facilities, to measure and manage the oxygen levels in the water, as too low or too high oxygen levels can affect the bacteria present in the water. Therefore, increasing adoption of water recycling is estimated to boost the market growth.  

However, poor awareness amongst wastewater treatment facilities is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of global dissolved oxygen sensors market over the forecast period.
