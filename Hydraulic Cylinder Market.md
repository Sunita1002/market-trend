Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global hydraulic cylinder market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing Construction Activities 
- Growing Utilization of Steam Engines 

**Challenges:**

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face substantial cost obstacles when entering the hydraulic cylinder market. In addition to the initial manufacturing expenses, regular maintenance is required for hydraulic cylinders to prevent oil leakages and other malfunctions. These ongoing expenses can increase over time and may hinder market growth.

Additionally, market growth may be hindered by fluctuations in the prices of raw materials.

By function, the global hydraulic cylinder market is segmented into single-acting and, double-acting. The double-acting sector is the market leader with a revenue share of 68.5% throughout the expected timeframe. Double-acting hydraulic cylinders are used in large engines like naval engines, steam turbines, industrial combustion devices, earthmoving equipment, and various construction machinery. The increased demand for these products in various applications is expected to drive growth in the market for double-acting hydraulic cylinders throughout the forecasted time frame.
