**Solar Panel Recycling Market Set to Surpass $2 Billion by 2035**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Solar Panel Recycling Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/global-solar-panel-recycling-market/1481): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global solar panel recycling market in terms of market segmentation by type, process, shelf life, end users, and by region. 

**Growing Environmental Concerns to Promote Global Market Share of Solar Panel Recycling**

The solar panels are anticipated to generate a sizable amount of waste after a projected 30-year lifespan, which is anticipated to exacerbate environmental problems globally. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) forecasts that 78 million tons of waste from PV panels will have been produced globally by 2050. The adoption of effective waste legislation and increased investments in the recycling of PV solar panels are expected to support market expansion in the future.

By 2050, PV recycling will generate over USD 12 billion in recoverable value in addition to more green job possibilities. Without having to make any investments in raw materials, this infusion will enable the production of 2 billion solar panels. This indicates that it will be possible to generate about 630 GW of energy only by using recycled materials. These factors are escalating the market growth rapidly. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global solar panel recycling market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing Government Initiatives
- Increasing Utilization of Solar Power Globally 

**Challenges:**

Solar cells use clean energy and don't pollute the air; however some harmful materials are employed during the production process, which has an impact on the environment. Solar cells also produce harmful byproducts that must be recycled when they have completed their life cycle.

The absence of infrastructure and knowledge regarding solar waste disposal is another problem. The majority of developing countries are not adequately informed about the potentially dangerous elements found in solar panels or how to appropriately dispose of them.

By process, the global solar panel recycling market is segmented into monocrystalline & polycrystalline, and thin film. Monocrystalline is anticipated to have the highest market share of these. Additionally, the monocrystalline form held the highest proportion of 50% in 2019. When compared to their rivals, they are the most space-efficient and demand the least amount of space. The lifespan of solar panels built of monocrystalline materials is longer, and they frequently outlive their warranty. Additionally, their need for telecommunication services and solar street lights is growing quickly. The monocrystalline market is being supported by these elements.

By region, the Asia Pacific solar panel recycling market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. In terms of utility, China is expected to lead the solar power market, and the country is striving to boost demand for rooftop solar systems. Since the nation's electricity market was deregulated, distribution-grid-connected (DGC) generators have had access to clients in the commercial and industrial sectors to sell power directly. Additionally, some of the region's top producers of solar energy are China, Japan, and India.  

In addition, the market in North America is estimated to hold the second-largest share by the end of 2035. The growth can be attributed to the presence of the largest solar panel recycling plant which has been opened in Yuma to handle the solar trash and address climate change. Furthermore, the region is shifting towards renewable energy sources, which may rise the demand for solar panel recycling in the coming years.

Also, market in Europe is expected to hold the significant share during the forecast period. Estimates predict that the quantity of solar panels nearing the end of their useful lives will result in more solar panel garbage. In light of this, it is anticipated that demand for solar panel recycling would rise over the next years. Due to technological advancements and strict government waste management regulations, the market for recycled solar panels in Germany is anticipated to surpass 70 million by 2027. Additionally, the region's fastest growing market for solar panel recycling was in Germany, while the UK market held the greatest market share.
