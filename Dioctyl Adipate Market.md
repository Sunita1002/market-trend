**Increasing Use of Chemical Plasticizers to Boost the Growth of the Market**

DOA has larger molecular space, high boiling point, and low vapor pressure, which makes it suitable to be used as a plasticizer. Plasticizers reduce the brittleness of any polymer, and increase its malleability and flexibility, which is highly essential in rubber cables, plastic sheets, and wires. This is estimated to significantly drive the market growth.  

However, declining use of plastics, backed by growing environment awareness is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of global dioctyl adipate market over the forecast period.
