Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “<a name="_hlk128148825"></a>[Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Diagnostics Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis-nash-diagnostics-market/4718): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics market in terms of market segmentation by type, end-user, and by region. 

**Growing Concern for the of NASH and NAFLD Disorders to Drive Growth of Global Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Diagnostics Market**

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to the disorder that can lead to serious problem in case it is not treated at the right time. An increase in the number of NASH and NAFLD cases, is one of the primary factors for the global nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics market. In addition, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased during the last decade. According to the study, the global prevalence of NAFLD between 2000 and 2021 was 29.38%, regardless of diagnostic methodologies. In the group where the diagnosis was made only by ultrasound, the pooled prevalence was 30.49%. NAFLD grew more common from 2011 to 2021 (31.63%, 95% CI 30.23-33.04) compared to 2000-2010 (27.94%, 95% CI 26.23-29.69).

Furthermore, the growing demand for providing novel diagnostic tool is predicted to surge the growth of the global nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics market. In addition, there have been growing popularity for non-invasive tests in the form of serologic tests and imaging techniques, that has been increasingly adopted by healthcare professionals are further expected to rise the market’s growth over the forecast period. For instance, the AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) score, Fibrosis-4 (Fib-4) calculator, and the NAFLD fibrosis score are among the serologic tests available (NFS). APRI score greater than one, NFS scores less than 0.676, and Fib-4 score greater than 2.67 all predict the presence of advanced fibrosis. An NFS less than -1.455 and a Fib-4 score less than 1.3, and on the other hand, indicate a low risk of advanced fibrosis.

The strict rules for approval of biomarkers by approval bodies, and the lack of demand in underdeveloped countries are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global <a name="_hlk128150163"></a>nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics market. In addition, the lengthy process for the clinical trials for the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics tools for the NASH treatment is further expected to hamper the market’s growth. In vitro diagnostics will be supervised by the FDA, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), and, soon, a formal regulatory framework in Europe. When the FDA, EMA, and PMDA approve innovative targeted therapeutics, the companion diagnostic test required to select patients receiving the therapy is considered for approval concurrently with the therapy.

By type, the global nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics market is segmented into <a name="_hlk128150650"></a>serum biomarkers, hepatic fibrosis biomarkers, oxidative stress biomarkers, apoptosis biomarkers and others. The serum biomarker segment is anticipated to hold the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to the availability of various serum biomarker-based tests on the market. Moreover, the effectiveness of the serum biomarker as an advanced diagnostic tool that is further expected to surge the growth of the segment in the market. In addition, the competitors in the market are getting easy approval from the authorized bodies for the marketing of the serum biomarker tests, which in turn, is predicted to contribute to the segment’s growth.

By region, the Asia Pacific nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics market is anticipated to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated as there is a surge in the growing popularity related to the liver disease diagnostics, along with the rise in the number of people suffering from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, there have been rising factors, that are contributing to the factors such as the increase in obesity cases, which is further expected to increase the growth of the market over the forecast period. On the other hand, the Asia Pacific nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics market is projected to witness the fastest growth by the end of 2036. This can be attributed to the disease burden of NAFLD in the region, that is predicted to rise in tandem with rising trends in metabolic syndrome and obesity among the region's populations. In addition, the increase in the population percentage in the region, is further projected to surge the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnostics market in the region. As a result, the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) disease cases in Asia Pacific stimulates market expansion.
