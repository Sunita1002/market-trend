Molded pulp packaging is a viable solution for eco-friendly packaging, but switching to eco-friendly packaging can be expensive and especially for small enterprises. The cost of production of pulp packaging is expensive, moreover, it is further burdened by fluctuating prices of the raw material. However, the practice of using molded pulp packaging can be cost-effective in long run but it is hard to predict the specific time. Therefore, it becomes expensive to deploy the pulp packaging and is expected to hamper the market growth.
