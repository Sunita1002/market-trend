Besides this, with the growing fluctuation in climatic conditions, the need for HVAC systems is significantly rising. It is expected that by 250, around 4.5 billion single-room will have air conditioning facilities. Furthermore, with rapid industrialization and the advent of Industrialization 4.0, the adoption of automated machines and robotic assistance has also been boosted. These types of equipment heavily employ permanent magnet motors to make this equipment energy efficient. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global permanent magnet motor market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surging Deployment of Robots in the Industries
- Rising Demand for Electric Vehicles

**Challenges:**

The raw material used in permanent magnet motors is made up of rare earth metals, including dysprosium and neodymium. It takes a lot of investment to mine this material and they are not readily available. Therefore, the constraints on the availability of these raw materials are expected to hinder market expansion. On the other hand, the manufacturing of these motors are highly complex and required a huge capital influx, hence there are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the market of permanent magnet motor.

Based on power rating, the global permanent magnet motor market is segmented into up to 25 kw, 25-100kw, 100-300 kw, 300 kw & above. The up to 25 kw segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The segment’s growth is expected on account of growing manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles. On the other hand, on the basis of end users, the market is fragmented into residential, commercial, and industrial. The industrial will dominate the market growth and the residential segment will also contribute significantly over the projected time frame. 

By region, the market in Asia Pacific, amongst the market in all the other regions, is projected to hold a majority of the share by the end of 2036. The growth of the market can be attributed majorly to advancements in manufacturing processes and materials that have led to cost reduction and made permanent magnet motors even more affordable in the region. Owing to this, several industries, including industrial automation and automotive, are implementing these motors to improve efficiency, improve overall performance, and reduce emissions.
