**Increasing Cyber-Attacks & Rising Remote-Work Culture to Promote Global Market Share of Multi-Factor Authentication** 

Organizations have had to adopt stronger security measures due to the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks. According to a survey, businesses worldwide reported 493.33 million ransomware assaults in 2022. The average cost of data breaches caused by stolen or compromised identifying documents was USD 4.5 million.  This increased demand for multi-factor authentication since, in such circumstances, MFA offers an effective defense against intrusions and breaches, making it an essential safeguard for sensitive data.

The prevalence of remote work and the Bring Your Device (BYOD) movement have increased cybercriminals' potential attack surfaces. Secure remote access to corporate networks, cloud services, and vital applications requires MFA. As of 2023, 12.7% of all employed people worked from home, and 28.2% used hybrids, creating a surplus of chances for the multi-factor authentication sector.
