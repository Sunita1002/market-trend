**Improved Diagnosis and Early Intervention to Promote Global Market Share of Vaso Occlusive Crisis**

Improved diagnostic tools, including genetic testing and newborn screening, have enabled early intervention for individuals with SCD. Early diagnosis allows for personalized care and treatment plans that can prevent or reduce the frequency of VOCs. This not only improves the quality of life for patients but also reduces healthcare costs associated with hospitalizations. A study in the American Journal of Hematology found that early diagnosis and comprehensive care plans have led to a 30% reduction in hospitalizations related to VOCs in children with SCD.

<a name="_hlk147244389"></a>Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global vaso occlusive crisis market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

•	Increasing Personalized Medicine and Targeted Therapies

•	Growing Telemedicine and Remote Monitoring

**Challenges:**

Health disparities disproportionately affect individuals with SCD, particularly those from marginalized communities. Access to specialized care, including hematologists and clinics with expertise in SCD, is often limited in certain regions. This can result in delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and poorer health outcomes for some patients. Sickle cell disease often receives less attention and funding compared to other chronic diseases. This lack of awareness can lead to delayed diagnoses, a shortage of resources for research and treatment, and a lack of public understanding about the challenges faced by individuals with SCD and VOCs.

<a name="_hlk147244479"></a>The supportive care segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Psychological support and counseling are essential components of supportive care during VOCs. Individuals with SCD often experience anxiety, depression, and stress due to the chronic nature of their condition and recurrent crises. The research conducted by the American Psychological Association highlights the significant impact of these services in reducing emotional distress, improving coping mechanisms, and enhancing mental well-being.
