Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Solid Vacuum Reclosers Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/solid-vacuum-reclosers-market/5288): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global solid vacuum reclosers market in terms of market segmentation by vehicle type, end-users

**Infrastructural Changes and Environmental Conditions** **to Promote Global Market Share of Solid Vacuum Reclosers** 

In many regions, the existing power infrastructure is aging and in need of upgrades. Solid vacuum reclosers are often chosen as replacements for outdated or less reliable reclosing devices, driving market growth as utilities and grid operators seek to enhance the performance and safety of their electrical systems. According to a report by the US Department of Energy, at least 70 % of American power transmission lines and transformers have been aged over 25 years. There's a major vulnerability there as the equipment won't be able to remain in place forever. There is a higher risk of failure in the old components. As per the authorities, a massive change in grid-line is needed including automation for damage control. This is attributed as a growth driver for Solid Vacuum Reclosers. 

Moreover, Solid vacuum reclosers are known for their eco-friendly properties. Unlike traditional oil-filled reclosers, they are environmentally safer and comply with strict regulations related to environmental protection. Growing environmental concerns and stringent regulations are pushing utilities and organizations to adopt greener technologies, including solid vacuum reclosers.

By Region, North America is expected to have the largest market share of about 46%, by the end of 2036. Government initiatives to improve grid dependability, an increase in the use of smart grid technologies, and the replacement of deteriorating infrastructure. Distribution automation and digital reclosers will increase the grid's dependability and efficiency. The mature electrical grid in the area requires infrastructure modifications. The increasing investment in renewable energy sources will be advantageous for businesses in the recloser industry. As of 2021, About 111 million advanced (smart) metrics infrastructures (AMI) installations, or 69% of all electric meter installations, were made by U.S. electric companies. About 88% of all AMI installations were for residential customers, while AMI meters made up about 69% of all residential electric meters.
