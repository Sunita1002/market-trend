Side effects of accessible materials are possible to restrain the market growth of the global hyaluronidase power injection market. However, hyaluronidase may create some undesirable impacts. Although not all of these side effects may appear, they may require medical attention. The most often reported negative reactions have been mild local injection site reactions like redness, swelling, itchiness, or pain. anaphylactic-like reactions, and allergic reactions, like hives, have been reported scarcely in patients getting hyaluronidase power injections.

By source, the hyaluronidase power injection market is segmented into animal-derived hyaluronidase, synthetic hyaluronidase, and bio-engineered hyaluronidase. In terms of source, the animal-derived hyaluronidase segment held the largest revenue share in 2023 and is anticipated to hold the position with 55% revenue share in the predicted timeline. It is anticipated to manage its dominance throughout the forecast period, as most registered and advertised brands are recently derived from animal sources. However, restrictions related to animal-derived products have prompted the growth and implementation of synthetic products. Several studies have demonstrated the high efficiency of recombinant human hyaluronidase in increasing the quality and protection of local anesthetic blocks.
