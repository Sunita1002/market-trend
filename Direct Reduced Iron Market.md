**Surge in Demand for EAF in Steelmaking to Boost the Growth of Global Direct Reduced Iron Market**

The global market for direct reduced iron is anticipated to grow on account of the growing demand for EAF in steelmaking. EAF steel production is an alternative to traditional blast furnace processes and is considered more environmentally friendly. EAF uses scrap metal as its main input instead of raw materials such as iron ore. Achieving the desired chemical composition of the steel requires additional iron units, which can be accommodated by incorporating DRI. DRI serves as a high-quality raw material for EAF, ensuring a stable supply of metallic iron and improving production processes by reducing impurities and increasing material efficiency. EAF steelmaking is known for its environmental benefits compared to traditional blast furnace steelmaking. EAF reduces energy usage, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and allows for better control of emissions. By using DRI as a raw material for his EAF, the environmental footprint of the steelmaking process can be further reduced.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global direct reduced iron market are: 

**Growth Drivers:** 

- Growing Development of Deep EGS  
- Rising Use of Enhanced Geothermal Systems in Building       Sector  

**Challenges:** 

In the case of DRI, there is a high level of competition in this market; however, some producers have to compete with other forms of iron production like blast furnaces and scrap steelmaking. The volatility of natural gas prices may have a bearing on the competitiveness of DRIs in comparison with these alternate methods. As compared to steel producers who use other methods for iron production, DRI producers may face difficulties in selling their products at competitive rates during periods of high gas prices.  



By form, the market for direct reduced iron is segmented into pellet, and lumps. In terms of form segmentation, the pellets segment is predicted to hold the largest market share of USD 61.68 billion up from USD 19.74 in 2023. However, the lumps segment is also projected to grow at the highest CAGR of 9.83% over the forecast period. A second type of raw material for the production of pure reduced iron is lumps, which in turn are commonly referred to as iron ore. Lumps have an important role to play as a feedstock for the production of DRI. The use of iron lumps is beneficial in terms of the following benefits, such as those obtained from raw materials which are extracted from ore mines and have not been processed nor pelletized into a lump form due to their natural state so that regions, where palletization does not take place, can be used.

By region, the market in Asia Pcific for direct reduced iron is also estimated to have significant growth in the market over the coming years. Asia Pacific is a region with less iron deposits which makes it dependent on other regions for getting iron. Steel producers in the region may be at risk of supply chain vulnerabilities and price fluctuations as a result of this reliance on imported iron ore. DRI plays an important role in resolving this problem by replacing the use of iron ore during traditional blast furnace processes. By using DRI, Asia Pacific steel producers are able to diversify their raw material resources and reduce their reliance on imported iron ore which is also a driving force for market growth in Asia Pacific.
