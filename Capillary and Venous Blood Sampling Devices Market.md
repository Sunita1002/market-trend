Capillary and venous blood sampling equipment are extensively used in hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare settings for blood collection. These technologies enable healthcare providers to rapidly and efficiently collect blood samples, lowering the risk of complications and ensuring the safety and accuracy of the blood samples. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global capillary and venous blood sampling devices market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rise in demand for blood collection and transfusions 
- Increasing demand for apheresis

**Challenges:**

Stringent regulatory approval and product recall associated with capillary and venous blood sampling devices, and limited access to healthcare in low and middle-income countries are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global capillary and venous blood sampling devices market.

By product, the global capillary and venous blood sampling devices market is segmented into capillary blood collection devices and venous blood collection devices. The venous blood collection devices segment is to garner the highest CAGR of 7.6% over the forecast period. This can be attributed due to the rising preference in clinical laboratories for the detection of major chronic diseases as no repeated blood collection process is required. Venous blood collection is the procedure often done in routine laboratory tests due to the benefits of these venous blood collection devices as they offer the exact filling volume. It has fueled the growth of capillary and venous blood sampling devices over the forthcoming years. Moreover, the main venous blood sampling devices are tubes and vacutainer systems used for cancer, HIV/AIDS and other blood testing which are fueling the expansion of the venous blood collection devices market. 

By region, the North American capillary and venous blood sampling devices market are to generate the highest revenue of USD 5,040.2 million by the end of 2035. The demand for capillary and venous blood sample devices is increasing along with the surging number of people suffering from communicable and non-communicable diseases. For instance, heart disease is the main cause of death for both sexes and the majority of American populations. Demand for blood testing for these illnesses will increase since almost 20% of all fatalities from coronary artery disease in 2020 will be in persons under the age of 65.
