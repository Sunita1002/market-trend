Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global computational biology market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising Research and Development in the Field of Technology
- Increasing Drug Discovery

**Challenges:**

The need for high investment associated with computational biology, and the high cost of maintenance are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of computational biology. Additionally, the lack of specialized, skilled, and trained professionals required to perform computational analytics is predicted to hinder market growth. All these factors are anticipated to restrict the market growth in the discussed period.

By application, the global computational biology market is segmented into cellular & biological simulation, drug discovery, disease modeling, preclinical drug development, clinical trials, human body simulation, and others. The drug discovery segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period owing to the increasing need for new drugs to treat the symptoms of new diseases. Furthermore, drug discoveries and drug development are also gaining importance to prevent the spread of new diseases such as COVID-19. Hence, the continued incidence of new diseases is anticipated to boost segment growth in the upcoming years.

Further, the commercials sub-segment from the end-user segment is expected to garner a substantial share of the market due to the incessant commercial investments and rising privatization of the healthcare industry.

By region, the North American computational biology market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by increasing research activities in the region. The growing investments in synthetic biology to design and build novel biological functions by applying computational tools to biology in the region are further anticipated to propel market growth in the region.

The Asia Pacific region is estimated to hold the second-largest share of the computational biology market by 2035 owing to the rise in the manufacturing of generic drugs and biosimilars that employs computational biology.

The European market is predicted to witness tremendous growth owing to the growing development of the genomics industry in the region.
