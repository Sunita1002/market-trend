Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global solid state drive market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Demand for Data Storage Among Various Applications 
- Rising Presence of People on Social Media and the Internet 

**Challenges:**

SSDs have a limited lifespan. This is because SSDs can only be written to a certain number of times before they start to wear out. The number of times an SSD can be written to is called its write endurance/ The write endurance of an SSD is determined by the type of NAND flash memory used in the SSD. SLC NAND flash memory has the highest write endurance, followed by MLC NAND flash memory and TLC NAND flash memory. Furthermore, the high cost of SSD and data security concerns associated with SSD are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of solid state drives.

By technology, the global solid state drive market is segmented into TLC 3D, TLC Planar, MLC 3D, MLC Planar, SLC. The TLC Planar segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. As the technology is switched from MLC to SLC and from MLC to TLC, the costs per GB of solid state drive are reduced. But there was also a significant growth in the MLC Planar sector. One of the important factors driving MLC NAND memory market development is increasing use of mobile phones, personal computers and tablets. Accordingly, market growth will be significantly affected by the rising use of MLC Planar for Solid State Drives.
