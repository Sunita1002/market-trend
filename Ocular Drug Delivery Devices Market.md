**Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Ocular Diseases to Drive Growth of Global Ocular Drug Delivery Devices Market**

The global ocular drug delivery devices market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing number of ocular diseases across the world. The ocular drug delivery system is always a challenge as the bioavailability of these drugs is very less. Many drug delivery systems are being developed to improve the efficiency and risk of diseases. Ocular diseases are caused by impairment of the eyes from occupational work, genetic disorders, immune suppression such as diabetes, and increasing screen time. The lack of awareness of eye diseases and infections is also estimated to drive market growth. The drug delivery systems of the eye include implants, inserts, injections, lenses, and plugs. The dosage forms of these drugs include ointments, solutions, suspensions, drops, microspheres, and nanoparticles. The reimbursement policies and aging are also the regions for the growth of the market in the coming years. As per the estimations for 2022, globally more than 2 billion people are living with near or far vision loss.

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Government Expenditure on Healthcare
- Growing Geriatric People Suffering from Eye Disorders

**Challenges:**

The rising concern for poor bioavailability of drugs and discomfort caused by administration are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global ocular drug delivery devices market.

By disease type, the global ocular drug delivery devices market is segmented into glaucoma, diabetic macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, cataract, refractive issues, and others. The cataract segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. A rise in the number of people living with diabetes and a growing number of people with age above 50 years is projected to drive the market growth. Also, the increasing number of people suffering from cataracts is growing along with the lack of awareness of treatment procedures is also boosting the market growth. The market growth is attributed to the poor medical facilities provided in underdeveloped countries and the rising presence of disorders such as diabetes, eye trauma, hypertension, and eczema which increase the risk of eye disorders. Globally, over 5 million people aged 50 and over are living with blindness as per the reports of 2020. 

By region, the North America ocular drug delivery devices market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. The rising chronic diseases such as immune suppression disorders are estimated to increase the risk of eye disorders which in turn hikes the market growth in the coming years. Vision impairment in many adults and the increasing geriatric population are estimated to propel the market growth. The increasing pharmaceutical industry, rising presence of prominent key players, and growing mergers and acquisitions in the region are also driving the growth of the market during the forecast period as per the market analysis.
