Significant technological improvements have been made in the abrasive blasting nozzles sector, particularly in the creation of new tools and materials. These developments have improved the effectiveness and worker safety of abrasive blasting nozzles, which has helped the industry expand. For instance, approximately 75% of respondents believed that AI would surpass all other technologies within three years. The second largest category, comprising over 50% of the total, was robotics and automation.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global abrasive blasting nozzles market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growing Awareness about the Benefits of Abrasive Blasting Nozzles
- Advancement in Technology 

**Challenges:**

Abrasive blasting operations can generate a lot of dust and noise. Lead paint and silica are two hazardous materials that could be present in both the surface being blasted and the abrasive material and represent a risk to the employees. Crystalline silica sand exposure increases the risk of silicosis, lung cancer, and breathing problems among workers.

Factors such as low abrasive media quality and the high cost of advanced abrasive blasting nozzles are some of the other factors that may hamper the market growth.
