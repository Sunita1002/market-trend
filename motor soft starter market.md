Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Motor Soft Starter Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/motor-soft-starter-market/5164): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global motor soft starter market in terms of market segmentation by voltage, power, application, end user, and by region. 

**Growing Production of Oil and Gas to Promote Global Market Share of Motor Soft Starter** 

The global motor soft starter market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the rising consumption of oil and gas. With the growing industrialization and urbanization, the need for transport, aircraft, faster manufacturing, and electricity is continuously increasing. Moreover, governments of various countries are also investing heavily in the exploration of new oil wells. All the factors lead to higher operation in the oil and gas sector, which in turn increases the demand for industrial equipment including motor soft starter, that is majorly used for controlling the initial supply of power for these major machines and types of equipment, thus driving the market growth.

Besides this, the world is undergoing a major transformation in industrialization, which has increased the adoption of automated machines. Automated systems frequently use motor soft starters for streamlines the functioning of the automated systems. Moreover, the rising production of sewage and the growing need for clean and safe water is also expected to drive the market growth.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global motor soft starter market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising Need for Wastewater Treatment
- Higher Use of Industrial Pump

**Challenges:**

The need for customization as per the demand for different industries has increased the complexity of the system and many people in the world are still very rigid towards adopting the new technologies. These are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of motor soft starter. On the other hand, the industry lacks a set of standardization, therefore manufacturers are not able to follow a standard design, which raises compatibility issues. Market growth is also slowed down owing to this major factor. 

On the basis of power, the global motor soft starter market is segmented into up to 750 W, and 751 W- 75 kW. The 751 W- 75 kW segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the market is attributed to the rising use of heavy machinery in various industries, including oil and gas, power generation, water treatment, and food & beverage. On the other hand, based on application, the market is divided into fans, pumps, compressors, elevators, & escalators. The elevators & escalators segment is set to have a tremendous growth, owing to the rising construction of the building, such as malls, residential apartment, and others, the installation of elevators is rising. 

By region, Asia Pacific is to grow at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth is primarily anticipated by rising production of power and high transmission is expected to drive the market growth. Moreover, the transmission lines infrastructure in Asia Pacific is over 50 years old, therefore the government is investing in redeveloping these infrastructures, which is further boosting the market growth. Moreover, the growing trend of industrial automation and smart manufacturing is augmenting the market growth in Asia Pacific.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global motor soft starter market which includes company profiling of ABB Ltd, Eaton Corporation, Siemens, Schneider Electric, Rockwell Automation, Inc., Emerson Electric Co., CG Power, and Industrial Solutions, LARSEN & TOUBRO LIMITED, WEG, and Carlo Gavazzi Holding AG.
