The market growth is expected to be driven by the increased CO2 emissions as a result of industrialization, growing awareness about carbon reduction, and globalization of supply chain networks. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global environmental intelligence platform** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Climate Awareness by the government
- Rising Need to Monitor Real-Time Analysis

**Challenges:**

The fact that SMEs have limited access to these platforms poses a major challenge for those who are limiting the growth of this market. The fact that people do not know about it is the primary factor that is challenging the market growth. Although there could be benefits, the use of environmental intelligence is also facing a number of challenges in terms of design, control, evaluation and deployment. Lack of awareness and limited access are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of environmental intelligence platform.

By deployment, the global environmental intelligence platform** market is segmented into cloud-based and on-premises. The cloud-based segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. A major factor contributing to this growth is the advantages of cloud computing, for example, lower costs, higher productivity, and reduced length of time consumption

By region, the North America environmental intelligence platform** market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. Increasing awareness of air pollution and initiatives by the government aimed at reducing CO2 emissions in the region is expected to increase this growth in the region over the forecast period. It can be expected that developments and implementation of new technologies in the region, e.g. the use of big data, artificial intelligence as well as analytical instruments, or other techniques will make it easier to develop a market for environmental intelligence platforms with greater capabilities and better performance.
