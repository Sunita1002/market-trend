**Growing Prevalence of this Types of Fish to Promote Global Market Share of Histamine Toxicity**

The global histamine toxicity market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased consumption of these types of fish. Histidine is a substance found in high concentrations in some fish species. Bacteria can convert this substance into histamine. When an allergic reaction occurs, mast cells produce histamine, which causes allergic symptoms. Therefore, eating fish high in histamine can mimic an allergic reaction to this dish. Histamine poisoning can be more easily caused by some types of fish. These include marlin, mahi mahi, tuna, mackerel, anchovies, bluefish, and amberjack. Therefore, when consumers eat these types of fish, they tend to suffer from histamine poisoning. In light of this, the rising consumption of these type of fish is believed to be the main driver of the market.
