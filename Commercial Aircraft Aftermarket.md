**Increase in the Number of Retired Aircraft to Facilitate the Used Serviceable Materials (USM) to Promote Global Market Share of Commercial Aircraft Aftermarket** 

The aviation industry suffered during the pandemic all over the world. In order to deal with this financial burden, airlines are rearranging their fleets and looking into retiring aircraft earlier. Due to this, the disintegration, deconstruction, and recycling of passenger airplanes have significantly increased since 2020. As a result, this aspect is raising the need for the USM domain of Used Serviceable Materials. Additionally, USM parts play a large role in the expansion of the commercial aircraft aftermarket. 

` `Storage space needs are reduced thanks to MRO asset management. The owners of aircraft may better manage warranties with the use of a contemporary industrial maintenance strategy. These elements are accelerating the market expansion for MRO components. If the costs of rehabilitation and repair for rotable.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global commercial aircraft aftermarket are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing Age of Aircraft Fleet
- Increase in E-Commerce 

**Challenges:**

Their operational expenses are being affected by the rising inventory costs associated with the storage of spare components. Additionally, other reasons including rising operational costs and the cost of aircraft fuel are elevating the concern for cost containment among airline operators. Such elements can limit the commercial aircraft aftermarket's market expansion. 

The airlines coordinate airplane maintenance with aftermarket component suppliers and MRO service providers. Most MRO facilities lack an integrated strategy with other services and are disorganized. As a result, if an aircraft owner needs maintenance, a lack of knowledge may add to their obligations, which would impede the market's expansion. 

By parts, the global commercial aircraft aftermarket is segmented into maintenance repair & operation parts, MRO and rotable replacement parts. The MRO parts are leading the market growth among the other parts. <a name="_hlk139984138"></a>The growing requirement for timely maintenance on such complex aircraft and the rising demand for upgraded aircraft. Additionally, MRO asset management contrib utes to a decrease in the need for storage space. The owners of aircraft may better manage warranties with the use of a contemporary industrial maintenance strategy. These elements are accelerating the market expansion for MRO components. A strong supply chain network is also present for MRO services and aviation parts among US-based companies.

By region, the North America commercial aircraft aftermarket is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. The expansion is attributed to the MRO and maintenance repair service providers who are concentrating on the rising aftermarket services investment in the US and Canada. A strong supply chain network is also present for MRO services and aviation parts among US-based companies. Additionally, the US's growing standardization of PMA procedures for parts manufacturer clearance will promote market expansion.

The market in Asia-Pacific holds the second-largest market share for the aftermarket for commercial aircraft. Launching aftermarket parts hubs in nations like China, Singapore, and Japan is receiving more funding. The market for aftermarket parts in China is anticipated to expand quickly. Government regulations on import and export have also significantly fueled business expansion.
