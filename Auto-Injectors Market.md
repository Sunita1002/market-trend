**Auto-Injectors Market: Growth Trends and Future Demand by 2036**

The North America auto-injectors market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by higher number of senior population. In the European Region, the number of people 60 and older is increasing quickly owing to migration, rising life expectancy, and decreasing fertility rates. This has led to a rise in the prevalence of diabetes in the region as the disease is more common among the elderly and more than 19 million adults in EU member states between the ages of 60 and 79 have the disease.

**Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Diabetes to Promote Global Market Share of Auto-Injectors** 

The global auto-injectors market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing cases of diabetes. Obesity is frequently cited as the primary cause of the rising incidence of diabetes as A BMI of over 34 kg/m2 increases one's risk of developing diabetes by more than 92 times. As a result, there would be an increasing demand for auto-injectors during the forecast timeframe as insulin jet injectors, which use a high-pressure air mechanism are a dependable and potentially more effective insulin delivery method for diabetics than needle injections.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global auto-injectors market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Product Approvals Globally
- Rising Need for Auto-Injectors in Children

**Challenges:**

The availability of other modes of drug administration, and the fear of injections among majority of people across the globe are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of auto-injectors. The methods used to administer pharmaceuticals can vary greatly as many people have a severe allergy to injections, the oral approach is usually advised for the majority of prescribed medications. This could thereby reduce the need for auto-injectors.

By disease indication, the global auto-injectors market is segmented into rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and anaphylaxis. The anaphylaxis segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. One serious and potentially fatal allergic reaction is anaphylaxis which usually occurs after consuming particular foods or receiving an insect sting. Fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts like walnuts are the foods that cause allergy responses in adults the most frequently they can alter the heart rate, sharply lower the blood pressure, and make it difficult to breathe. These factors may result in high demand for adrenaline auto-injectors as they include epinephrine, which is used to treat severe allergic responses or anaphylaxis.

Moreover, one of the most significant health problems affecting the elderly population in any given area is diabetes complications which is acknowledged as a significant contributor to early mortality and disability. All these factors are expected to increase the demand for auto-injectors in the region as it is a sophisticated and relatively new advancement in the treatment of diabetes which is made to use a high-pressure air mechanism to deliver a fine mist of insulin through the skin that can enable insulin injection for diabetics without the need for a needle.  With more than 23% of the overall population 65 years of age and older in 2022, Italy had the highest proportion of elderly people in all of Europe.

Besides this, the rising prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in Europe is expected to create a huge demand for auto-injectors in the coming years. For instance, in Europe, more than 2 million people receive an RA diagnosis annually. This as a result has significantly driven the market growth. Enbrel and Benepali are both offered as auto-injector devices in the region however, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Europe stated that they preferred the Benepali auto-injector over the Enbrel MYCLIC auto-injector.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global auto-injectors market which includes company profiling of Scandinavian Health Ltd., AbbVie, Inc., Amgen, Owen Mumford, Ypsomed, Biogen Idec, Mylan N.V., Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi, Stevanato Group, and others.
