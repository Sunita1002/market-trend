**Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Cancer to Promote Global Market Share of Cholangiocarcinoma** 

Growing infections like liver fluke are fueling the market's expansion, which will increase demand and have an effect on the bile duct cancer market by driving up treatment costs. At least 2.4 million people are affected in more than 70 countries, and several million more could get infected if they live in areas where sheep or cattle are kept.

Additionally, the need for drugs with minimal side effects and combination therapy are two more aspects that are expected to drive market expansion. In addition to this, many new projects are being started to improve the condition of cancer therapy. To find cancer treatments and other necessities to make patient care easier, a lot of research is being done. The market for cholangiocarcinoma treatment has a lot of growth potential as a result of hospitals and clinics offering cancer patients more contemporary healthcare options.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global cholangiocarcinoma treatment market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in New Drug Approvals by Regulatory Bodies
- Rising the use of Organic Growth Techniques

**Challenges:**

The high expense of treating cholangiocarcinoma is expected to hamper the market growth over the course of the projected period. For instance, on June 11, 2023, data from the online pharmaceutical research indicates that cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and other conditions are commonly treated with Keytruda (pembrolizumab), a drug that is a member of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies drug class. A four-milliliter supply of Keytruda intravenous solution (25 mg/mL) costs around USD 5,747. Moreover, the same source claims that a supply of 14 oral pemazyre pills, each containing 4.5 mg of dose, costs over $19,000 USD. Early stage detection and high cost are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of cholangiocarcinoma.

By distribution channel, the global cholangiocarcinoma treatment market is segmented into hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies and e-commerce. The retail pharmacies segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The increased availability of prescription and over-the-counter drugs in retail pharmacies is expected to fuel the growth of the cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) treatment market. The convenience of being able to fill many prescriptions and purchase a variety of medical supplies in one place is presumably a major factor in the growing popularity of retail pharmacies.  Dispensing roughly 138,000 prescriptions annually per store—nearly 50% more than grocers—retail chains are the largest distributors of prescription drugs per retail location.

By region, the North America cholangiocarcinoma treatment market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by the government's support for pharmaceutical research and development, the availability of funding for studies, and the growing number of patients in the region.
