**Increasing Population & availability of fertilizers in varied forms to Promote Global Market Share of Chemical Fertilizers** 

There is a shortage of arable land with a growing worldwide population, chemical fertilizers are used to boost crop output, which has an impact on global market trends. The naturally existing productivity of young-of-year culture organisms that support crop growth is reportedly increased by the use of chemical fertilizers. Aside from this, combining chemical and organic fertilizers increases the yield of cottonseeds, dried grains, and rice bran.

Moreover, chemical fertilizers are more used in liquid fertilizers recently. With liquid fertilizers, the loss of nitrogen is reduced and functions are increased. Furthermore, liquid fertilizers can be used on a single pass in combination with additional nutritional supplements and protection products. This has resulted in the growth of the market, as a result of savings on time, fuel consumption, labor costs, and pollution.
