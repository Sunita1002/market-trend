Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Small Gas Engines Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/small-gas-engine-market/4920): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035” delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global small gas engines market in terms of market segmentation by application, equipment, type, and by region. 

**An Increase In Outdoor Power Equipment Demand To Promote Global Market Share Of Small Gas Engines**

The global small gas engines market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increase in the demand for outdoor power equipment. Outdoor power equipment is available for sale to individuals and institutions such as homeowners, rental yards, and colleges. Furthermore, there is an increasing trend of using gas engines to clear snow from unwanted areas. In regions with population density and heavy rainfall the demand for outdoor power tools and equipment is also on the rise. For instance, Sukayu Onsen in Japan receives a snowfall of approximately 690 inches and has been identified as one of the most densely populated areas, with heavy rainfall based on reports.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global small gas engines market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising demand for portable power sources, such as electric generators, mowers, and pumps
- Increasing focus of manufacturers on the development of eco-friendly, advanced, and fuel-efficient small gas engines

**Challenges:**

Increasing environmental regulations have made it difficult for manufacturers to produce small gas engines, as they have to comply with stringent emission norms. Additionally, rising concerns about air pollution and rising fuel prices have compelled people to shift towards electric and hybrid engines, further hampering the growth of the small gas engine market.

By equipment, the global small gas engines market is segmented into portable generator, lawnmower, chainsaw, leaf blower, pressure washer. The lawnmowers segment will dominate the market holding the market share of approximately 38%. This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for lawnmowers in both residential settings. Lawns, public parks and gardens often require grass cutting and having a lawnmower handy becomes essential. 

Moreover, long grass can become a breeding ground for insects like mosquitoes that carry diseases like dengue. Small gas engines are particularly popular in lawnmowers due, to their nature, portability and power. They not offer better fuel efficiency compared to larger engines but also require minimal maintenance.

By region, the North America small gas engines market is set to generate the significant revenue by the end of 2035. The significant expansion of the regional market can primarily be credited to the increasing investment in technology and the rising awareness surrounding pollution reduction, particularly in countries. Furthermore, the strict regulations imposed by governments, on emissions are expected to drive the growth of the small gas engine market in North America. 

Moreover, natural gas is a cheaper and cleaner burning fuel than diesel and gasoline, and its increasing availability has made it an attractive option for small engine manufacturers. The demand for small gas engines in the region is expected to rise as more people switch to natural gas as their primary fuel source.
