Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Foot Orthotic Insoles market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Technological Advancements such as 3D printed foot orthotics
- Increasing Geriatric Population

**Challenges:**

The industry’s growth is challenged by the less awareness about the product and treatment for foot pains, mostly in developing nations. In these nations, most of the people with supination and pronation of the foot arch have limited accessibility and are not aware of the treatment in the market. Furthermore, clinical providers in lower-middle-income countries do not have enough product options to meet the customer’s needs. In addition, prices of these foot orthotic insoles also tend to be at higher levels, further restraining the growth.

By distribution channel, the global foot orthotic insoles market is segmented into online and offline. The online segment is to garner the highest CAGR over the forecast period. This can be attributed to the increase in online vendors in several countries. In addition, players in the orthopedic insoles market have adopted a strategy of product innovation to meet the changing needs of customers across the globe, which also enables brand retention in the global market.

By region, the North America foot orthotic insoles market, is projected to grow at a tremendous growth rate and accumulate a revenue of USD 1.7 billion by the end of 2035. This can be attributed to the growing geriatric population in the North America region, as orthopedic diseases are more common amongst the elderly. In the region, the elderly population (aged over 60) is anticipated to triple between 2010 and 2050
