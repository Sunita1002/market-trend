**Calcium Carbonate Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on “[Calcium Carbonate Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/calcium-carbonate-market/5097): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitor’s analysis and a detailed overview of the global Calcium Carbonate market in terms of market segmentation by type, end-use industry, and by region. 

**Increasing Demand in the Paints & Coatings Industry to Elevate the Growth of the Global Calcium Carbonate Market**

For the production of powder coatings and emulsion paint, calcium carbonate is widely used in the paint industry. It serves as a diluting agent and can be used to monitor the shine of paints and coatings. Thus, the significant properties of calcium carbonate increase its demand in the industry. Ultrafine calcium carbonate paints and coatings have a spatial steric effect. Applying ultrafine calcium carbonate that has been activated by a chelated paint dispersion and coupling agent can enhance the ability of the covering to resist abrasion, adhere, withstand impact, and be flexible. Additionally, it can enhance color intensity and reflectivity. Ultrafine calcium carbonate can help in dispersion, pigment settling, and shine in the aqueous paint industry. According to SHC Group Company, a Vietnam-based company that specializes in mineral fields, Aqueous paints typically contain 20%-60% calcium carbonate. By reducing settling, calcium carbonate can reduce the quantity of dispersion used in latex paints.

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising Application Across Various End-use Industries
- Expanding Construction Industry

**Challenges:**

High transportation costs are one of the major factors affecting the calcium carbonate industry. Several companies have recently increased the quantity of their calcium carbonate goods due to rising raw material transportation costs, which is one of the variables influencing price. Furthermore, the additional cost of moving PCC from the place of manufacture to the paper mill raises the total cost of transportation. For instance, in April 2023, Minerals Technologies Inc., a U.S.-based resources and technology company, signed three long-term precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) supply agreements in with Andhra Paper Limited, an Indian paper mill company, Nine Dragons Paper, a Hong Kong-based pulp mills company, and Zhejiang Zhefeng New Materials Co.'s, a Chinese manufacturer and supplier of plastic packaging materials, to build and operate on-site precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) satellite plants, which will expand the Company's Specialty Additives product line in China and India. To cut costs, some businesses also ship calcium carbonate in slurry form, albeit this could degrade the product's quality. Therefore, the rising cost of transporting calcium carbonate from one location to another limits market expansion.

By type, the ground calcium carbonate (GCC) segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. GCC is mainly produced from minerals or marble deposits to create powdery-like forms which are categorized by size and other properties. Moreover, GCC's functional properties, such as high brightness, large surface area, controlled particle size, high stability, and correct formulation, enable it to be used in a variety of industries.

By region, in recent years, Asia Pacific also witnessed a significant growth in the utilization of calcium carbonate across several industries, and sectors. The increased construction activities coupled with residential, and commercial developments, and several infrastructure projects across the region, notably in the U.S., have resulted in higher demand for construction material, particularly ground calcium carbonate (GCC). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a U.S. government agency, U.S. construction spending in April 2023 was USD 1,908.4 billion, a 1.2% rise from USD 1,885.0 billion in March 2023.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global calcium carbonate market which includes company profiling of Imerys, Omya AG, Minerals Technologies Inc., Huber Engineered Materials, Mississippi Lime Company, Carmeuse, SIBELCO, Provencare SA, ACCM, Gulshan Polyols Ltd, Shiraishi Group, MARUO CALCIUM CO., LTD., Takehara Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., HAYASHI-KASEI, and NITTO FUNKA KOGYO K.K.
