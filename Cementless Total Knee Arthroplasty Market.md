**Preference for Cementless TKA by Surgeons and Patients to Promote Global Market Share of Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty**

Cementless TKA has gained popularity due to its potential benefits, such as reduced risk of implant loosening and infection. Many orthopedic surgeons and patients prefer cementless TKA as it provides a more bone-conserving option compared to cemented TKA. Research published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (JBJS) reveals that cementless TKA is associated with a lower revision rate compared to cemented TKA. Patients and surgeons are increasingly choosing this option to achieve better long-term results.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global cementless total knee arthroplasty market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

•	Increasing Prevalence of Osteoarthritis

•	Growing Regulatory Environment and Quality Assurance

**Challenges:**

In many regions, access to specialized orthopedic care, including TKA procedures, may be limited, particularly in rural areas. Patients in underserved areas may face difficulties in getting timely and appropriate treatment. This lack of access can delay necessary surgeries. High-quality cementless TKA implants can be expensive. The cost of these implants may pose a financial barrier for healthcare providers and patients, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources. Cost-effective solutions and pricing strategies are needed to ensure wider accessibility.

<a name="_hlk147244479"></a>The primary cementless TKA segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Obesity is significant growth driver for primary cementless TKA procedures within the global market. Obesity is a well-established risk factor for osteoarthritis and knee joint problems. With rising obesity rates in many parts of the world, an increasing number of individuals are at risk of developing osteoarthritis and may ultimately require primary cementless TKA to address the joint damage resulting from excessive weight. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that obesity rates have been steadily increasing worldwide, with obesity now considered a global epidemic. Obesity-related osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability, underscoring the necessity for joint replacement procedures, including primary cementless TKA.

<a name="_hlk147244557"></a>By region, the Asia Pacific cementless total knee arthroplasty market is to generate <a name="_hlk140522455"></a>a notable revenue by the end of 2036. Asia Pacific has a steadily aging population, with a significant percentage of individuals over the age of 65. As people age, the risk of developing knee-related conditions, such as osteoarthritis, increases. This demographic shift drives the demand for joint replacement procedures, including cementless TKA. Osteoarthritis is a leading indication for TKA, and its prevalence is on the rise in Europe. Factors such as lifestyle changes and obesity contribute to the increasing incidence of knee joint problems, necessitating joint replacement surgeries. Europe is a hub for medical technology innovation. Continuous advancements in implant design, materials, and surgical techniques have significantly improved the success and longevity of cementless TKA procedures. These innovations enhance patient outcomes and surgeon efficiency.
