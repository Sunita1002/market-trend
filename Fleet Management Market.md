**Immense Significance of Fleet Safety to Boost the Growth of the Global Fleet Management Market** 

The global fleet management market is stated to grow on account of the immense significance of fleet safety. Between 2012 and 2021 in Great Britain, it was noted that more than 51 goods vehicle occupants died on the roads each year. When fleet vehicle accidents are at fault, they have serious repercussions. Such accidents have a number of negative effects, including high insurance premiums, expenditures associated with overtime spent filling in for absent drivers, expensive medical costs, and lost productivity among employees. Fleet management should go a long way toward ensuring secure fleet movement. A key component of fleet management solutions is safety management using tools such as in-vehicle computers. These solutions would also lessen the requirement for braking suddenly and going too fast, which would decrease the likelihood of damage to the transportation vehicles. Reduced instances of wear and tear should also make it possible to reduce the size of the fleet and make financial savings.

The growing reliance on public transit is also anticipated to increase demand for fleet management on the global market. According to estimates, Americans took more than 9 billion journeys on public transit in 2019.  For those traveling in areas where using a private vehicle would be time- and money-consuming, public transport is a lifeline. As a result of the ability of businesses to communicate with a sizable workforce base dispersed over a sizable area, it also aids in maintaining the health of an economy. By employing information about the number of passengers on a route and the position of the vehicles, fleet management may increase the effectiveness of the local public transport system while also making the journeys profitable for the entire network.  

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global fleet management market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growth in the Use of Wireless Technology by Automotive 
- Rise in International Trade After the Pandemic 

**Challenges:**

Continuous network and data access are necessary for fleet management. However, in impoverished and emerging nations with a partial or very acute lack of connectivity, this poses a significant difficulty. About 91% of people in low- and middle-income nations don't have access to reliable internet connections, according to estimates. Inadequate routing and interruptions in the availability of fleet information are two effects of inadequate connectivity that could significantly impede market expansion. 

By industry, the market for fleet management is segmented into construction, manufacturing, mining, transportation, oil & gas, and others. The transport sector is anticipated to increase its market share the most among these over the forecasted time range. By 2035, the industry is anticipated to develop at a CAGR of 14% and hold a 40% share of the market. With time, fleet management technologies would inevitably be used in logistics and transportation. For efficient last-minute deliveries, these solutions are primarily used to plan and manage the dispatch schedule, optimize spending, and track the movement of items and vehicles in real-time. The movement of things from their originating location to their destination was not monitored by the conventional fleet management system. However, advanced fleet management solutions contain metrics such delivery routes, real-time position tracking, and movement speed to shorten journey and delivery times. Considering all of these, the growing transportation sector is anticipated to propel the market expansion of the category.

By region, the North American fleet management market is anticipated to garner the largest revenue by the end of 2035. By the end of 2035, the region's market share is predicted to be 31%. The U.S. and Canada, which are predicted to hold a share of 75% and 25%, respectively, in the regional market in 2023, should aid the area in gaining such a sizable market share. The market's expansion in North America could be largely ascribed to the successes of fleet management companies there that made timely investments in fleet tracking technologies. For instance, in the United States, where about 97% of fleets had installed GPS fleet tracking software in 2021, about 33% of users claimed to have had a positive return on investment (ROI) within a month of putting the fleet technology in place.
