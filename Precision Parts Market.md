Additionally, several aircraft manufacturers have increased their investments in the provision of Unmanned Vehicles Ariella. Therefore, by observing innovation in the aircraft industry, precision components are expected to contribute positively to the overall Precision Parts market over the forecast period. Replacing light materials with strong heat and pressure resistance material and parts is expected to result in an increased need for precision parts amongst aircraft manufacturers, while upgrading the basic plane components.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global precision parts market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing demand of healthcare and medical devices.
- Rise in Automotive Industry 

**Challenges:**

Fluctuating price of raw materials, demand for smaller lot sizes and miniaturization of precision parts are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of precision parts.

By application, the global precision parts market is segmented into aerospace, automobiles, electronics, healthcare, consumer packaged goods and others. During the forecast period, the aerospace industry should be dominant on the market. In view of the conditions encountered by aircraft as a result of their speed, air currents and excessive pressure, precise construction is needed in order to ensure that aircraft do not suffer damage. The global industry has been strongly supported by the increase in production of fighter planes and aircraft for national security. There is a significant impact on the market from increased capital investment by the space industry over the last decade.

The North America is anticipated to hold the largest market share over the forecast period  accounting for 45% of the market and is estimated to reach USD 72 billion by 2035 growing at a CAGR of 11%. Significant updates to environmental legislation in the United States by the EPA and favorable tax and credit incentives provided by federal governments have substantially increased demand and sales of electric vehicles in this country. This is a major factor in the region. Furthermore, significant growth in this market can be attributed to the increasing application of diagnostics and healthcare equipment. The US is among the world's leading producers of vehicles, and this has also had a significant impact on growth in precision parts across the region.

Further, for Europe's market, sustainable growth is foreseen. The market is projected to bring in revenue of USD 64 billion by the end of 2035. A key factor projected to stimulate market growth is an increase of technology innovation in the production of medicines and health care products. Moreover, an increasing demand from civil and military aviation is driving the market.
