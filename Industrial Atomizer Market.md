The rapid urbanization and industrial growth increased the aviation sector and transportation system which are expected to propel the market growth in the coming years. The manufacturing of medicines is also increasing with the incidence of numerous healthcare disorders across the region and is estimated to have a positive impact on the market growth during the forecast period as per the market analysis. As per the data of Invest India, 13% out of USD 81.72 of the foreign direct investment inflow was spent on infrastructure-related operations in India during 2021. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global industrial atomizer market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growing Demand for Pharmaceutical Sector with Rising Healthcare Spending
- Rising Food and Beverage Industry with Increasing Preference for Processed Food Products

**Challenges:**

The rising concern for the risk of deposition and surface erosion of the products manufactured through the atomizer process is estimated to hinder the market growth. The inappropriate fluid flow rate, viscosity, density, rotary speed, aerosol density, angle of spray, pressure, design, composition, and type of device are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of the industrial atomizer. Less time gap between two coatings, wrong pressure, and flow for the liquid or gas can lead to uneven and thick coatings on the surface of the end product. 

By type, the global industrial atomizer market is segmented into semi-automatic, automatic, and nozzle types. The nozzle type segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The increasing use of deodorants and perfumes is estimated to propel the market segment growth. The deodorants, and antiperspirants used in various countries such as the U.S., Germany, France, and the UK gained a profit of USD 260 million, USD 240 million, USD 170 million, and USD 140 million respectively as of 2021 reports. The rising applications of nozzles in jet combustors to release fuel during power generation and growing use in gas stoves, ovens, and barbecues to release gas is estimated to propel the market segment growth in the coming years. The increasing use of nozzle atomizers to spray lightweight paints in automobiles is estimated to hike the market segment growth.
