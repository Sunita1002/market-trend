**Growing Demand for Secure Communication to Promote Global Market Share of Public Key Infrastructure**

This makes sure the message comes from the assured sender and is not being disturbed during transit. Thus, increasing demand for secured communication as a result of concern regarding data breaches, cyberattacks, and authentication theft boomed the market expansion.
