By product, the global calcium phosphate market is segmented into monocalcium phosphate, di-calcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, and calcium acid phosphate. The di-calcium phosphate segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the growing demand for water all across the globe. The total annual water demand for all applications worldwide was expected to be about 4,600 km3 in 2019 and 5,500–6,000 km3 in 2050, an increase of 20–30%. Hence the use of di-calcium phosphate is estimated to boost water treatment owing to its sorbent nature.

By region, the Asia Pacific calcium phosphate market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035, backed by growing demand for chicken, along with the growing focus on animal health. China produced the most chicken meat in the Asia-Pacific area in 2020, at around 14 million metric tons. Moreover, along with growing meat production, the focus of people on a nutritional-based diet is also growing which usually contains all crops. Hence, agricultural activity is estimated to boost the demand for calcium phosphate.
