**Increasing Production of PET Bottles to Drive Growth of Global Alkylene Oxides and Glycols Market**

The global alkylene oxides and glycols market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the PET bottle output is being increased. PET bsottles are a cheap form of plastic which are widely used in a variety of modern commercial and household applications, making them popular with consumers and business owners. In addition to being used for storage or transportation, they may also be used to package frozen foods as well as beverages, baked goods, and water bottles. Further, PET bottles can be employed to retain a range of cosmetics since they are simple to mold. According to studies, one million plastic bottles are purchased globally every minute. Every day, it amounts to roughly 1.5 billion plastic bottles.

Moreover, the increasing popularity of packaged foods is further expected to drive the growth of the global alkylene oxides and glycols market. Meals in a package are convenient and easy to make. Usually, in a small household where both parents work, they prefer to provide their kids with ready-to-eat meals. Foods that are professionally produced and prepared for consumption are packaged as convenience items. Further, the sharp growth in wealth and the improvement in living standards are the driving forces behind the rise in the usage of packaged foods, they also require less trash management and disposal. According to the most recent expenditure data, ready-to-eat foods and skyrocketing out-of-home consumption were mostly responsible for the over 90% increase in packaged food sales in the months preceding the holiday season. The entire anticipated period is anticipated to experience this spike.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global alkylene oxides and glycols market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- ` `Growing Adoption of Packed Foods 
- ` `Increasing Need to Sterilize the Medical Devices

**Challenges:**

The rising concern for the toxicity content found in alkylene oxides and Glycols as they are extremely reactive chemical substances that are manufactured in large-scale operations across the world under tightly regulated settings. They may be further processed into a wide range of downstream products that are employed in a number of industries owing to their high reactivity. For instance, the central nervous system (CNS), followed by the heart and kidneys, are the first organs that are impacted by ethylene glycol and its harmful byproducts. Taking in too much might result in death. Further stringent regulations developed by the government of nations worldwide on the use of non-biodegradable plastics and the consumption of fossil fuels are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global alkylene oxides and glycols market. The government's severe laws governing the usage of non-biodegradable plastics and the consumption of fossil fuels are one of the main problems anticipated to limit the market's growth. For instance, fossil fuel is the "virgin" feedstock used to make nearly 90% of single-use plastic products.

By alkylene type, the global alkylene oxides and glycols market is segmented into ethylene, propylene, and butylene. The ethylene segment is expected to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to an increase in the usage of ethylene oxides and glycols as antifreeze and coolants in commercial and industrial applications. Antifreeze-based coolants are often used in the automotive industry. Further, antifreeze substances are used in mechanical equipment to prevent heat transfer fluids from freezing at subfreezing temperatures. In addition, coolants in many forms—such as solid, liquid, or gaseous—are used during machining operations to lessen friction and heat generated in the contact zones between cutting tools and workpieces. Moreover, coolants enhance the workpieces' surface quality, slow down the rate of tool wear, and stop the development of built-up edges (BUE).

By region, the Asia Pacific alkylene oxides and glycols market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. The growth is attributed to the rising demand for bottle grade PET in the region. The convenience of handling PET bottles is driving up demand for bottle grade PET, which in turn is attributed to an increase in demand from the food and beverage industry. Additionally, PET bottles are frequently used by businesses as they are less prone to break and are as transparent as glass. They offer strong barrier qualities and are easier to recycle owing to their single-layer, single-material construction. Also, the majority of household products, like floor cleaning acids, toilet cleansers, and dishwashing solutions, are packed in PET bottles. Furthermore, PET bottles are increasingly being used in the area for pharmaceutical packaging to package cough syrups, antacids, vitamins as these are shatter proof, light weight and reduce wastage.
